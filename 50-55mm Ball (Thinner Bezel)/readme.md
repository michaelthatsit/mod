The mod is designed for a 55mm ball, but works with 50-55mm balls.

About This Model
====================
![50-55mm Ball Preview](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/8ee7afa14d9289efde0b2ceb388cd7a4018f164f/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/50-55mm-Ball-_Thinner-Bezel_1.jpg?raw=true)

This design is a modified version based on the 55mm short version originally created by [@fabriciobastian](https://github.com/fabriciobastian)
  
I’d like to express my sincere thanks to [@fabriciobastian](https://github.com/fabriciobastian) for creating such a great model.  
[50-55mm ball (short version)](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/tree/master/50-55mm%20ball%20(short%20version))  


BOSCH Rexroth BTUs must be used. 
I haven't tried anything else, but looking at users' reviews, it's terrible. Buy BOSCH Rexroth BTUs. 
I bought it on [this site](https://www.robaraindustries.com/en/product/42563/ball-transfer-units-r053010810-ku-b8-ofk-rex.html)
 (it took me 3 weeks with the cheapest shipping option)

About the LEGO-Compatible Case
====================
The case with LEGO brick mounts was designed specifically for 3D printing using PA12 MJF material.
This structure relies on MJF’s powder-based printing method to be printed properly.
(If you're not sure what that means, I recommend watching a YouTube video showing how MJF printing works.)

Because of this, using this file with FDM printing will require support structures.
Since I don’t have in-depth knowledge of 3D printing, I wasn’t able to figure out a way to print this model without supports.
So, I have also included a modified version optimized for FDM printing that does not require support.
<br>


FDM-Specific Versions
====================
![BTU Top for FDM (Fillet/Chamfer)](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/5a980747faac74fdc6aa74962dc1e30e391c58c4/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/BTU%20top%20for%20FDM%20fillet-cham.png?raw=true)

To help ensure better print quality with FDM, I’ve included two versions:
one with chamfered corners and one with filleted edges.
I haven’t tested which one prints better, so it’s entirely up to you to choose.
<br>

  
Spring Adjustments for MJF
====================
![Spring Detail](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/634f739cf9b138c64db2a507b7218daf26c4e0e9/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/spring.png?raw=true)

Since MJF materials are more flexible, I’ve increased the thickness of the button spring from 0.6mm to 1.2mm.
There are also a few other minor adjustments to help prevent damage during MJF post-processing.
<br>

  
FDM Version Details
====================
The FDM version keeps the original 0.6mm spring design.
Also, the pillar that holds the LEGO brick was removed to allow the surface to be printed facing down, resulting in better quality.
<br>

  
Palm Rest (Bonus)
====================
![Palmrest Preview](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/83cc894b9fb993e3cbe6419580608828139cb136/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Palmrest.jpg?raw=true)
I’ve also included a palm rest, just in case anyone finds it useful.
It was a quick 10-minute design, so I wasn't sure whether to share it, but I uploaded it anyway.
Since it was printed with MJF, there is a hole at the bottom.

It can be too short or too narrow because it's tailored to my hand.  
Make sure to check the size.  
It measures 92.7mm by 79mm.  
The height matched the case.  
<br>

  
Final Note
====================
Once again, please note that I have never printed this model using FDM materials.
This version simply shares the same design with a modified 0.6mm spring thickness.
Unexpected issues may arise.
If you enjoy experimenting, feel free to try printing with my file.
But if you prefer a well-tested and stable version, I recommend using one of the existing mods.
  
Thank you!
