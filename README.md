<sup>\*chances are your ball is compatible if it's within the \[min, max\] range, and it probably is.</sup> \
<sup>\*\*kindly consider [supporting Ukraine](https://u24.gov.ua) to fight Russia in the ongoing invasion and occupation.

## General tips

### Printing

1. There MUST be no supports, unless you really know what you are doing.

2. PLA, PETG, ABS — any of those are fine. 

3. If you experience bad tracking, you may want to print and install spacers.

### Other

1. Insert magnets on a flat hard surface while the device is not assembled.

2. Cyanoacrylate (superglue) works nice for magnets.

3. If you are experiencing buttons sticking, try reassembling without the sensor cover.

## 50-55 mm ball

Also available for non-standard BTUs: 
[SP-8](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/issues/5), [Veichu-15](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/issues/11).

> If you use CY-8H Aliexpress BTUs, it is recommended to go with the 50-52.4mm version instead. \
> You can ignore the fact that it is deprecated in such a case. \
> That version (in combination with this BTUs) should work with a 55 mm ball too.

CY-8H BTUs from AliExpress [are compatible](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/issues/6), with one exception so far. \
[SP-8](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/issues/5) and [Veichu-15](https://github.com/adept-anyball/mod/issues/11) are not directly compatible, but there are model(s) available.

## Magnets

You will need 4x2 mm circular neodymium magnets, full set (device + buttons) is 24pcs. \
They MUST be glued, ideally with a cyanocrylate based glue. 

## Quality Assurance

We have the best of the best.
