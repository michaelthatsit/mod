## After Receiving the Package from JLC
![JLC Packaging](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/8e74e8d43174bb9c2544ebb85e6870862ea003aa/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/jlc.JPEG?raw=true)

Once your parts arrive from JLC, check everything carefully.  
If any parts are missing or the surface finish has issues, file a quality complaint.  
In my experience, JLC's customer service has responded well in most cases their support is excellent.
![Surface Cleaning](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/dirty.JPEG?raw=true)

Due to the MJF post-processing method, there may be some black powder residue on the surface.  
You can wipe it off or gently clean it using mild detergent.  
Although MJF prints are quite sturdy, be especially careful with the **top case spring structure**, which can be fragile.



## 1. Attach the Bumpers (If Needed)
![Bumper Attachment](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/bum.JPEG?raw=true)

If you're using bumpers, attach them first.  
You could attach them later, but if you flip the case after installing the BTUs, BTUs may fall off and cause annoyance.



## 2. Insert the PCB into the Bottom Case
![Case Assembly](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/assemble.JPEG?raw=true)

Place the PCB into the bottom shell.  
The grooves are designed to align precisely, so it should fit easily.  
Then place the **sensor cover** on top of the PCB.

There is a hole at the bottom of the case to lower the overall height of the trackball.  
If you're worried about accidental liquid spills entering through this hole, it's recommended to cover it with tape for protection.


## 3. Assemble the Top Shell and Tighten Screws
![BTU Installation](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/btu.JPEG?raw=true)

Combine the top shell and fasten the screws.  
You may not feel a tight grip. that‚Äôs okay. Gently try pulling the two halves apart.  
If they stay together, the fit is good enough.

At this point, **press all six buttons** to ensure they actuate correctly.  
Sometimes, due to slight 3D printing tolerances, a button might be constantly pressed.  
In that case, **slightly file down** the point of contact. Just a little will do.

Once all 6 buttons work fine, insert the **BTUs**.  
Depending on the print tolerance, the BTUs may slide in easily or feel tight.  
I printed this mod twice, and both had different BTU fitment.

If too tight, don't worry ‚Äî you can **push the BTUs out from underneath** using a stick through the bottom of the top case.



## 4. Attach the Magnets
![Magnet Attachment - Step 1](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/magnet1.JPEG?raw=true)

This part can be nerve-wracking at first.  
To practice, **start with the button magnets**, as they're cheaper and easier to reprint if mistakes happen.

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure all magnets are installed with the **same polarity**.  
This step is critical for the next step to work properly.

Also, ensure the magnets are **flush and not sticking out**.
![Magnet Attachment - Step 2](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/magnet2.JPEG?raw=true)

After attaching magnets to the buttons, move on to the case.  
Since the buttons will stick to the case, you need to attach the case magnets with **opposite polarity**.

If you accidentally attach the same polarity on both sides, the buttons will repel and not stick.



## 5. Place the Ball and Insert LEGO Brick
![Final Assembly](https://github.com/Dexter-KBD/mod/blob/316abd50027329fc95061f0bf5042964325b481b/50-55mm%20Ball%20(Thinner%20Bezel)/Image/Assembly%20guide/finish.webp?raw=true)

Place the trackball into the BTUs, and fit an appropriate LEGO brick into the 6 o‚Äôclock position.  
Then, upload your VIA or Vial firmware and start using the device.

At first, it may feel **extremely smooth**, making fine control difficult.  
That‚Äôs okay with a bit of practice, you‚Äôll get used to it.

Wishing you a successful assembly!  
Thank you üôè
